We are working on an updated/modified version of original firmware for the VESC (based on FW3.33).


Key functions

#1 Multi-turn posistion control (controlling motor position over multiple encoder turns, for example 0-2160Degress)

#2 Removed shortest route rotation -+180 degress


future work:

#1 Looking on how to implement a cascaded style position, velocity and current control loop.
